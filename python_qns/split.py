'''
Both split() function and slicing work on a String object. By using split()
function, we can get the list of words from a String.

Slicing is a way of getting substring from a String. It returns another String.
'''
s1='hello world'
print('split function is:')
print(s1.split())



s2='hello good morning'
print('slicing functions is:')
print(s2[6:10])
